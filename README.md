# News-App
An android application developed with kotlin appling MVVM architecture with network layer with repository pattern to be able searching for news and reading them.

Just download and run it on Android Studio.

This app is fetching new from an news API, You can check it out there: https://newsapi.org/?ref=apilist.fun

I used an API_KEY to access news, if you want to change it, just go through com.abanoub.news.data and change value of API_KEY attribute

Also, I used some third libraries such as: Glide, Retrofit, Coroutines and Koin
